## DJ Glovie
Contains all the UI code independent of the functional back-end bluetooth code. This is the front end of our project. 

# Feather_Bluetooth_Comm
Contains the "functional" side of the application. Has a text box to debug received input from the Arduino Feather board. 

# Spotify_Control_Example
Initially a proof of concept. Has nothing but a couple of buttons that do the same things our glove does.
