# Short Description of Arduino Programs

## Bluetooth_Glove
Final code that will run on the feather board. Sends special messages to Android via bluetooth for Spotify control.

## Simple_Button
Program to test our circuit with so we don't go insane (even though we already have). The circuit for this program requires a few extra LED hookups to test that each button is working properly.
